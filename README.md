# BlockSwap
[BlockSwap](https://blockswap-sandy.vercel.app/)

### Blockswap is a web3 based cryptocurrency swapping application. It was developed in Solidity for the contracts, and React for the front-end development. This site is a dive into develpoing blockchain applications. and I can confidently say that Solidity is a very difficult language to use. 

### The site requires a metamask account to use, and BNB testcoin. The functionality is limited to Ethereum and BNB swapping, but theoretically the contract would be able to support other transactions if a valid liquidity pool is set up. 

#### The swapping funcionality of the site is likely out of date, since the world of crpytocurrency and solidity devlelopment moves extremely quickly. However, I believe it was a highly valuable learning experience as it gave me hands on development experience with web3 and I can better comprehend the technology.
